--> About: 
The Terminal Chat Application is a Java-based program that enables users to communicate with each other via text messages through terminal windows. It utilizes Socket Programming, a networking concept, to establish a connection between two terminal instances running on the same or different devices within the same network.

--> Features:
1) Text-Based Communication: Users can exchange text messages in real-time using their terminal windows. The application supports one-to-one communication between two users.
2) Terminal Interface: The user interface of the application is based on the terminal/command-line interface, providing a simple and lightweight communication platform.
3) Socket Programming: The application leverages Socket Programming in Java to establish a network connection between two terminal instances. It uses sockets to send and receive messages over the network.
4) Cross-Device Communication: Users can communicate with each other even if they are using different devices, as long as they are connected to the same network.
5) Real-Time Updates: Messages are sent and received in real-time, allowing for seamless and immediate communication between users.
6) User Identification: Each user may have a unique identifier or username to distinguish them from other users during the chat session.

--> Conclusion:
The Terminal Chat Application provides a lightweight and efficient means of communication between users via terminal windows. By leveraging Socket Programming in Java, the application enables real-time text-based communication over a network, allowing users to interact with each other seamlessly, regardless of the device or platform they are using.
